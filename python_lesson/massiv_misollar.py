Input: nums = [1,15,6,3]
Output: 9
Explanation:
The element sum of nums is 1 + 15 + 6 + 3 = 25.
The digit sum of nums is 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 16.
The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is |25 - 16| = 9.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The element sum of nums is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
The digit sum of nums is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
The absolute difference between the element sum and digit sum is |10 - 10| = 0.
